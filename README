NAME
    Log::Handler - Log messages to one or more outputs.

SYNOPSIS
        use Log::Handler;

        my $log = Log::Handler->new();

        $log->add(file => {
            filename => 'file.log',
            mode     => 'append',
            maxlevel => 'debug',
            minlevel => 'warn',
            newline  => 1,
        });

        $log->alert("foo bar");

DESCRIPTION
    This module is just a simple object oriented log handler and very easy
    to use. It's possible to define a log level for your programs and
    control the amount of informations that will be logged to one or more
    outputs.

WHAT IS NEW, WHAT IS DEPRECATED
  More than one output
    Since version 0.40 the method "add()" is totaly new. With this method
    you can add outputs as much as you wish, each with its own level range
    and different other options. As example you can add a output for the
    levels 0-4 (emergency-warning) and another output for the levels 4-7
    (warning-debug). Each output is handled as a own object.

  Log::Handler::Output
    This module is used to build the output message and is just for internal
    usage.

  Outputs
    There are different output modules available:

        Log::Handler::Output::File
        Log::Handler::Output::Email
        Log::Handler::Output::Forward
        Log::Handler::Output::Screen

    You can add the outputs on different ways. Take a look to the further
    documentation.

  Message layout
    Placeholders are now available for the message layout in "printf()"
    style. The old style of <--LEVEL--> is deprecated and you should use %L
    instead. The layout can be defined with the option "message_layout".
    "prefix" is deprecated as well.

  Configuration file
    Now it's possible to load the configuration from a file. There are 3
    configuration plugins available:

        Config::General
        Config::Properties
        YAML

    Take a look into the documentation for Log::Handler::Config.

  New options
        dateformat
        priority
        message_pattern
        trace

  Changed options
        prefix  is now  message_layout
        debug   is now  debug_trace

  Kicked options
        rewrite_to_stderr

  New methods
        add()           - to add new outputs
        config()        - to load outputs from a configuration file
        set_pattern()   - to create your own placeholder
        fatal()         - merged levels: 0-2
        is_fatal()      - to check if one of the level 0-2 is active

  Kicked methods
        close()
        get_prefix()
        set_prefix()

  trace()
    The method "trace()" writes "caller()" informations to all outputs by
    default. It's possible to disable this by set the option "trace" to 0.

  Backward compatibilities
    As I re-designed the Log::Handler it was my wish to support the old
    style from version 0.38.

        my $log = Log::Handler->new(filename => 'file.log');

    That still running fine because the options are forwarded to the file
    output. The exceptions are that the option "redirect_to_stderr" and the
    methods "set_prefix()", "get_prefix()" and "close()" doesn't exist any
    more. In all other cases you can use all things from 0.38.

  Further releases
    Extensions and changes are planed. I hope I have enough time to
    implement my ideas as soon as possible! Version 0.40 will be the next
    full release.

LOG LEVELS
    There are eigth levels available:

        7   debug
        6   info
        5   notice, note
        4   warning, warn
        3   error, err
        2   critical, crit
        1   alert
        0   emergency, emerg

    "debug" is the highest and "emergency" is the lowest level.

METHODS
  new()
    Call "new()" to create a new log handler object.

        my $log = Log::Handler->new();

  add()
    Call "add()" to add a new output object.

   OPTIONS
    maxlevel and minlevel
        With these options it's possible to set the log levels for your
        program.

        Example:

            maxlevel => 'notice'
            minlevel => 'emergency'

            # or

            maxlevel => 'note'
            minlevel => 'emerg'

            # or

            maxlevel => 5
            minlevel => 0

        It's possible to set the log level as a string or as number. The
        default setting for "maxlevel" is "warning" and the default setting
        for "minlevel" is "emergency".

        Example: If "maxlevel" is set to "warn" and "minlevel" to
        "emergency" then the levels "warning", "error", "critical", "alert"
        and "emergency" would be logged.

        You can set both to 8 or "nothing" if you want to disable the
        logging.

    timeformat
        The "timeformat" is used for the placeholder %T. You can set
        "timeformat" with a date and time format that will be converted by
        "POSIX::strftime". The default format is "%b %d %H:%M:%S" and looks
        like

            Feb 01 12:56:31

        As example the format "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S" would looks like

            2007/02/01 12:56:31

    dateformat
        The same as "timeformat". It's useful if you want to split the date
        and time:

            $log->add(file => {
                filename       => 'file.log',
                dateformat     => '%Y-%m-%d',
                timeformat     => '%H:%M:%S',
                message_layout => '%D %T %L %m',
            });

            $log->error("an error here");

        Would log

            2007-02-01 12:56:31 ERROR an error here

        This option is not used on default.

    newline
        This helpful option appends a newline to the output message if a
        newline not exist.

            0 - disable (default)
            1 - enable - appends a newline to the log message if not exist

    message_layout
        With this option you can define your own message layout with
        different placeholders in "printf()" style. The available
        placeholders are:

            %L   Log level
            %T   Time or full timestamp (option timeformat)
            %D   Date (option dateformat)
            %P   PID
            %H   Hostname
            %N   Newline
            %C   Caller - filename and line number
            %p   Script - the program name
            %t   Measurement - replaced with the time since the last call of the handler
            %m   The message.

        The default message layout is set to "%T [%L] %m".

        As example the following code

            $log->alert("foo bar");

        would log

            Feb 01 12:56:31 [ALERT] foo bar

        If you set "message_layout" to

            message_layout => '%T foo %L bar %m %C'

        and call

            $log->info("baz");

        then it would log

            Feb 01 12:56:31 foo INFO bar baz (script.pl, line 40)

        Traces will be appended after the complete message.

        You can create your own placeholders with the method
        "set_pattern()".

        Placeholders are documented in the section "PLACEHOLDER".

    message_pattern
        This option is just useful if you want to forward messages with
        Log::Handler::Output::Forward or insert the message with
        Log::Handler::Output::DBI or dump messages to the screen with
        Log::Handler::Output::Screen.

        Possible placeholders/names:

            %L   level
            %T   time
            %D   date
            %P   pid
            %H   hostname
            %N   newline
            %C   caller
            %p   progname
            %t   mtime
            %m   message

        The option expects a array reference with a list of placeholders:

            message_pattern => [ qw/%T %L %H %m/ ]

        Or with names

            message_pattern => [ qw/time level hostname message/ ]

        Here a full code example:

            use Log::Handler;

            my $log = Log::Handler->new();

            $log->add(forward => {
                forward_to      => \&my_func,
                message_pattern => [ qw/%T %L %H %m/ ],
                message_layout  => '',
                maxlevel        => 'info',
            });

            $log->info('a forwarded message');

            # now you can access it

            sub my_func {
                my $params = shift;
                print "Timestamp: $params->{time}\n";
                print "Level:     $params->{level}\n";
                print "Hostname:  $params->{hostname}\n";
                print "Message:   $params->{message}\n";
            }

    priority
        With this option you can set the priority of your output objects.
        This means that messages will be logged at first to the outputs with
        a higher priority. If this option is not set then the default
        priority begins with 10 and will be increased +1 with each output.
        Example...

        We add a output with no priority

            $log->add(file => { filename => 'file.log' });

        This output gets the priority of 10. Now we add another output

            $log->add(file => { filename => 'file.log' });

        This output gets the priority of 11... and so on.

        Messages would be logged at first to priority 10 and then 11. Now
        you can add another output and set the priority to 1.

            $log->add(screen => { dump => 1, priority => 1 });

        Messages would be logged now at first to the screen.

    die_on_errors
        Set "die_on_errors" to 0 if you don't want that the handler croaks
        if normal operations fail.

            0 - will not die on errors
            1 - will die (e.g. croak) on errors

        The exception is that the handler croaks in any case if the call of
        "new()" fails because on missing params or wrong settings.

    trace
        With this options it's possible to disable the tracing for a output.
        By default this option is set to 1 and tracing is enabled.

    debug_trace
        You can activate a simple debugger that writes "caller()"
        informations for each log level that would logged. The debugger is
        logging all defined values except "hints" and "bitmask". Set
        "debug_trace" to 1 to activate the debugger. The debugger is set to
        0 by default.

    debug_mode
        There are two debug modes: line(1) and block(2) mode. The default
        mode is 1.

        The block mode looks like this:

            use strict;
            use warnings;
            use Log::Handler;

            my $log = Log::Handler->new()

            $log->add(file => {
                filename    => '*STDOUT',
                maxlevel    => 'debug',
                debug_trace => 1,
                debug_mode  => 1
            });

            sub test1 { $log->warn() }
            sub test2 { &test1; }

            &test2;

        Output:

            Apr 26 12:54:11 [WARN] 
               CALL(4): package(main) filename(./trace.pl) line(15) subroutine(main::test2) hasargs(0)
               CALL(3): package(main) filename(./trace.pl) line(13) subroutine(main::test1) hasargs(0)
               CALL(2): package(main) filename(./trace.pl) line(12) subroutine(Log::Handler::__ANON__) hasargs(1)

        The same code example but the debugger in block mode would looks
        like this:

               debug_mode => 2

        Output:

           Apr 26 12:52:17 [DEBUG]

                 filename    /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.8/Log/Handler.pm
                 line        681
                 subroutine  Log::Handler::_write
                 hasargs     1
              CALL(0):

                 hasargs     1
                 wantarray   0

    debug_skip
        This option let skip the "caller()" informations the count of
        "debug_skip".

            debug_skip => 2

            Apr 26 12:55:07 [DEBUG]

   How to use add()
    The method excepts 2 option parts; the options for the handler itself
    and for the output module you want to use - the output modules got it's
    own documentation for all options.

    Okay, now there are different ways to add a new output object to the
    handler. You can create the output object yourself and pass it with the
    handler options to "add()".

    Example:

        use Log::Handler;
        use Log::Handler::Output::File;

        # the handler options - how to handle the output
        my %handler_options = (
            timeformat      => '%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S',
            newline         => 1,
            message_layout  => '%T [%L] %S: ',
            maxlevel        => 'debug',
            minlevel        => 'emergency',
            die_on_errors   => 1,
            trace           => 1,
            debug_trace     => 0,
            debug_mode      => 2,
            debug_skip      => 0,
        );

        # the file options - how to handle the file
        my %file_options = (
            filename        => 'file.log',
            filelock        => 1,
            fileopen        => 1,
            reopen          => 1,
            mode            => 'append',
            autoflush       => 1,
            permissions     => '0660',
            utf8            => 1,
        );

        # we creating the file object
        my $file = Log::Handler::Output::File->new( \%file_options );

        # now we add the file object to the handler with the handler options
        my $log = Log::Handler->new();
        $log->add( $file => \%handler_options );

    But it can be simplier! You can merge all options and pass them to
    "add()" in one step, you just need to tell the handler what do you want
    to add.

        # merge the options
        my %all_options = (%output_options, %file_options);

        # pass all options and say what you want to add -> a file!
        $log->add( file => \%all_options );

    The options will be splitted intern and you don't need to split it
    yourself, only if you want to do it yourself.

    Further examples:

        $log->add( email   => \%all_options );
        $log->add( forward => \%all_options );

    Take a look to the section EXAMPLES for more informations.

  Log level methods
    debug()
    info()
    notice(), note()
    warning(), warn()
    error(), err()
    critical(), crit()
    alert()
    emergency(), emerg()

    The call of a log level method is very simple:

        $log->info("Hello World! How are you?");

    Or maybe:

        $log->info("Hello World!", "How are you?");

    Both calls would log - if the level INFO is active:

        Feb 01 12:56:31 [INFO] Hello World! How are you?

  is_* methods
    is_debug()
    is_info()
    is_notice(), is_note()
    is_warning(), is_warn()
    is_error(), is_err()
    is_critical(), is_crit()
    is_alert()
    is_emergency(), is_emerg()

    These thirteen methods could be very useful if you want to kwow if the
    current log level would output the message. All methods returns TRUE if
    the current set of "minlevel" and "maxlevel" would log the message and
    FALSE if not. Example:

        $log->debug(Dumper(\%hash));

    This example would dump the hash in any case and pass it to the log
    handler, but that is not that what we really want!

        if ( $log->is_debug ) {
            $log->debug(Dumper(\%hash));
        }

    Now we dump the hash only if the current log level would log it.

    The methods "is_note()", "is_warn()", "is_err()", "is_crit()" and
    "is_emerg()" are just shortcuts.

  fatal(), is_fatal()
    Fatal is a extra level that can be used for CRITICAL, ALERT and
    EMERGENCY messages. A lot of people like to use just DEBUG, INFO, WARN,
    ERROR and FATAL. For this reason I though to implement it. You just have
    to set minlevel to critical, alert or emergency to activate this level.

  trace()
    This method is a special log level and very useful if you want to log
    "caller()" informations. In contrast to the log level methods this
    method forces "caller()" informations to all outputs and you don't need
    to activate the debugger with the option "debug_trace". Example:

        my $log = Log::Handler->new();

        $log->add(file => { filename => '*STDOUT' });
        $log->trace("caller informations:");

    Output:

    Maybe you like to forward "caller()" informations to all outputs if an
    unexpected error occurs.

        $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { $log->trace(@_) };

    If you want to disable tracing to a output you can use the option
    "trace" for it.

  errstr()
    Call "errstr()" if you want to get the last error message. This is
    useful with "die_on_errors". If you set "die_on_errors" to 0 the handler
    wouldn't croak on failed write operations. Set "die_on_errors" to
    control it yourself.

        use Log::Handler;

        my $log = Log::Handler->new();

        $log->add(file => {
            filename      => 'file.log',
            maxlevel      => 'info',
            mode          => 'append',
            die_on_errors => 0,
        });

        $log->info("Hello World!") or die $log->errstr;

    Or

        unless ( $log->info("Hello World!") ) {
            $error_string = $log->errstr;
            # do something with $error_string
        }

    The exception is that the handler croaks in any case if the call of
    "new()" or "add()" fails because on missing or wrong settings!

  config()
    With this method it's possible to load your output configuration from a
    file.

        $log->config(filename => 'file.conf');

    Or

        $log->config(config => {
            file => {
                default => {
                    newline       => 1,
                    debug_mode    => 2,
                    die_on_errors => 0
                },
                error_log => {
                    filename      => 'error.log',
                    maxlevel      => 'warn',
                    minlevel      => 'emerg',
                    priority      => 1
                },
                common_log => {
                    filename      => 'common.log',
                    maxlevel      => 'info',
                    minlevel      => 'emerg',
                    priority      => 2
                },
            }
        });

    The default section - I call it section here - can be used to define
    default parameters for all file outputs.

    Take a look into the documentation of Log::Handler::Config for more
    informations.

  set_pattern()
    With this option you can set your own placeholders. Example:

        $log->set_pattern('%X', 'name', sub { });

        # or

        $log->set_pattern('%X', 'name', 'value');

    Then you can use this pattern:

        $log->add(forward => {
            filename        => 'file.log',
            message_layout  => '%X %m',
        });

EXAMPLES
  LOG VIA FILE
        use Log::Handler;

        my $log = Log::Handler->new();

        $log->add(file => {
           filename => 'file1.log',
           mode     => 'append',
           newline  => 1,
           maxlevel => 7,
           minlevel => 0
        });

        $log->debug("this is a debug message");
        $log->info("this is a info message");
        $log->notice("this is a notice");
        $log->note("this is a notice as well");
        $log->warning("this is a warning");
        $log->warn("this is a warning as well");
        $log->error("this is a error message");
        $log->err("this is a error message as well");
        $log->critical("this is a critical message");
        $log->crit("this is a critical message as well");
        $log->alert("this is a alert message");
        $log->emergency("this is a emergency message");
        $log->emerg("this is a emergency message as well");

    Would log

  DIFFERENT OUTPUTS
        use Log::Handler;

            mode     => 'append',
            maxlevel => 7,
            minlevel => 7,
            trace    => 1,

            maxlevel => 4,
            minlevel => 0,

        # log to debug.log
        $log->debug("this is a debug message");

        # log to common.log
        $log->info("this is a info message");
        $log->notice("this is a notice");
        $log->note("this is a notice as well");

        # log to error.log
        $log->warning("this is a warning");
        $log->warn("this is a warning as well");
        $log->error("this is a error message");

        $log->emerg("this is a emergency message as well");

        # force caller() informations just to error.log and debug.log
        $log->trace("trace this call");

  is_* example:
        use Log::Handler;
        use Data::Dumper;

        my $log = Log::Handler->new();

        $log->add(file => {
           filename   => 'file1.log',
           mode       => 'append',
           maxlevel   => 4,
        });

        my %hash = (foo => 1, bar => 2);

        $log->debug("\n".Dumper(\%hash))
            if $log->is_debug();

    Would NOT dump %hash to the $log object!
