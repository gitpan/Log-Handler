0.13    Released at 2007-04-20.
        Added the availability to activate debugging with "Log::Handler debug => 1".
0.12    Released at 2007-04-15.
        Fixed DESTROY(). DESTROY() tries to unlock $self->{fh} in any case.
        Autoflush wasn't set if the option "filename" was set to STDOUT or
           STDERR or a GLOBREF.
0.11    Released at 2007-04-10
        Add the methods set_prefix() and get_prefix(). Did some POD changes.
0.11_02 Released at 2007-04-04
        Add the alternative to set "nothing" as option for minlevel and
          maxlevel.
0.11_01 Released at 2007-04-04
        I changed the log levels because they wasn't in the right order.
          0 debug     is now 7
          1 info      is now 6
          2 notice    is now 5
          3 warning   is now 4
          4 error     is now 3
          5 crit      is now 2
          6 alert     is now 1
          7 emergency is now 0
          8 nothing is still the same
          If you set maxlevel and minlevel as strings in your code than
          you don't need to change your code, but if you used numbers
          than you must change it! BIG sorry to all users that have to
          re-write code in this case.
        Thanks to betterworld for his tipps about the log levels! (thx pepe ;-))

          with the option "filename".
0.09    Released at 2007-03-01.
        Fixed t/03handler.t. The test log file was in unix format
          t/Log-Handler-Test-File.log, now it use File::Spec catfile().
        Forget to CLOSE() the log file in t/03handler.t and test fails
          on Windows.

        Now it's possible to hand off GLOBREF to option filename.

          - fileopen => 1
          - filelock => 0
          - reopen   => 0

        Added eight new methods:
